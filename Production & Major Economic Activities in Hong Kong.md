## i/Primary production 

Primary production is insignificant 微不足道 in Hong Kong in terms of its contribution 貢獻to the total value of production 生產總值, as shown in the following table. Hong Kong is densely populated and hilly 口稠密，丘陵多. In 2012, only 0.6% of its area (7 $$km^2$$) out of 1,104 $$km^2$$ was actively farmed 積極養殖. Farms are generally small and produce mainly leafy vegetables, pigs or poultry 葉類蔬菜、豬或家禽. 

## ii/Secondary production

The manufacturing sector has undergone 發生 big changes since the 1980s. Due to 由於 the mainland’s 內地的 open door policy and its low production costs 生產成本, many Hong Kong manufacturing firms 製造企業 have been relocated 遷往 there. The mainland acts as a production hinterland 生產腹地 for Hong Kong manufacturers. While labour 工作力-intensive 密集型 processes 過程 have relocated to southern China, Hong Kong concentrates on 專注于 high value added 增值 and technology 科技 -intensive manufacturing processes. The two major manufacturing industries in Hong Kong are a/printing 印刷業 and publishing 出版業 and b/textiles 紡織品.
